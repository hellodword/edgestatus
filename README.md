        > Our current thinking is that when using WebSockets, you'll be charged for wall clock time whenever a message is being processed by the Durable Object on any WebSocket connection - this charge would be shared across all WebSockets connected to a given Durable Object. When there is no CPU activity on a Durable Object, but any number of WebSocket connections remain established, you'll be billed a much lower active connection charge, per second.
